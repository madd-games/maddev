x86 Assembler TODO
==================

 * YMM and ZMM registers. Use the normal mspec but emit VEX/XOP as necessary. For some reason they decided to add
   a "v" prefix to some instructions; for this reason, the instruction "addpd" is listed as "*addpd", which causes
   the assembler to match both "addpd" and "vaddpd". This will apply to INSN_XMM_RM instructions; the assembler
   shall imply that the mandatory prefix and opcode map may be replaced by VEX and that a target for a non-destructive
   source operation is to be allowed etc.
  
 * Addends for relocations in RIP-relative addressing, when something follows the ModR/M byte; the number of following bytes
   should be subtracted from the addend.
