<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>
The macro-compiler (<code>mac</code>) is responsible for translating code in an intermediate representation (the <i>macro-language</i>) to assembly language for a target architecture. The command <code>mac</code> takes no command-line arguments, and reads macro-language code from standard input (including flags), and writes assembly to standard output.
